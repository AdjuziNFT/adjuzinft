    In february 2022, a military conflict started that is currently shaking
    the world. It is the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
    <br>
    Several countries have sent military aid in the form of supplies and
    weapons to Ukraine, but not much have been written (in comparison)
    about the aid to normal citizens and refugees of Ukraine.
    <br>
    <br>
    After spending countless hours everyday updating news sites to update
    myself on the conflict I thought about how I could help. My interest in
    crypto currencies and knowledge about web design made me set up this
    website and a crypto wallet. Donations to the wallet can be made with
    the currencies listed below and the donations will be used to help
    humanitarian organizations aid the people and refugees of Ukraine.
    The donations will not go to funding weapons and the like. There is an
    article on cryptonews.com that brings up several ways to donate if you
    want to support armed forces.

    1% of the donated sums will go towards things like potential
    administrative costs needed to get the money to the humanitarian
    organizations and to further develop this website. This is to keep
    this project alive and going.
</p>

<p>
    Do you have a suggestion to what humanitarian organization the money should
    be donated? Do you have a suggestion on a crypto currency to be made available
    for donations? Or do you have any other suggestions about the website or in
    general?
